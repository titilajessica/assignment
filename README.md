<p> In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, an idea to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.
     In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. 
     The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.
      The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. 
      Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft.</p>

<p>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.
    Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.
    According to Musk, all three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster prototype.
    Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.
    Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.
    Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.

 Tesla's "master plan", as iterated by Musk in 2006 was: Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. 
  While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options.</p>

<h5><strong> CEO and Product Architect </strong></h5>

<img src= "Unknown.png" alt="Tesla" width="200" height="200">

<p> Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and converted it into its solar division; the announcement of the deal resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. 
    At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues; however, Tesla shareholders were not informed.[186] Consequently, multiple shareholder groups have filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.
     During a June 2019 court deposition, Musk acknowledged that the company reallocated every possible employee from the solar division to work on the Model 3, and, according to Musk, "as a result, solar suffered." 
     This had not previously been disclosed to shareholders. 
     Court documents unsealed in 2019 have confirmed that Musk was also aware of the company's liquidity issues.[186] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendent. 
     Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.
     By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.
     In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla would collaborate to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013. </p>

   <h3>Education</h3>
     
   <p> While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.
     Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military.
     He left in 1992 to study economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; 
     he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences.
    In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.
    Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime who had hired Musk, noted: "He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out."
    In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Ph.D. program in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California.
    In California, Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape, but never received a response to his job inquiries.
    He ended up dropping out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an internet startup instead.</p>
